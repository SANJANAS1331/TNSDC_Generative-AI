Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN

This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for recognizing handwritten digits. The model will be trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The CNN architecture will include convolutional layers to extract features, pooling layers to reduce dimensionality, and fully connected layers for classification. ReLU activation will be used for the hidden layers, and softmax activation for the output layer. The trained model will be evaluated on a separate test set to measure its accuracy. The project will also explore techniques to improve the model's performance, such as data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning.
